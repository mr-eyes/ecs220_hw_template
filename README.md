A template repo that does the following:
- You work/collaborate on LaTeX files under `tex/` directory then it will be auto-rendered to PDFs under the `pdfs` directory.
- You can create any file with `*.tex` extension, and it will be converted to pdf.
- The workflow build will only be triggered if you changed a `tex` file.

**Please note that you will need to create a personal token with `repo` permission and insert it into your repo with the name `ECS220_WRITE_SECRET`. [https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)**
